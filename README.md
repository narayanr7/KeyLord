# KeyLord

After searching the whole github after a effective linux keylogger I've decided to build my own

# TODO

- [ ] send to server
- [ ] log to HD
- [ ] start/stop process
- [ ] create permissions to specific user
- [ ] Compile keylogger with pyinstaller
- [ ] on startup
- [ ] cant be killed by other users/subprocess hiding
- [ ] send via email overtime
